# 000002 - Standard Format for Post-Delivery Estimate Reflections

## Context

As part of our ongoing practice improvement and estimation accuracy feedback, we’ve introduced a lightweight reflection process for completed issues. These reflections allow us to assess the quality of our point estimates, record observed deviations, and optionally recalibrate expectations for future planning.

They also enable structured extraction of estimation trends over time, especially for solo or small-team environments where implicit retrospectives can go unrecorded.

## Decision

We will standardize a comment format—submitted by Nova—on all completed stories with meaningful execution effort. This format is designed for both human clarity and future machine parsing.

The format includes fields for:
- Original estimate
- Actual time spent
- Revised estimate (if re-pointed)
- Explanation for discrepancies
- Assessment of scope stability
- Confidence score with brief rationale

```text
Post-Delivery Estimate Reflection (submitted by Nova):

Story Points Assigned: [original estimate]
Actual Time Spent: [duration or coarse-grain]
Revised Estimate (if re-pointed): [updated point value]

Reason for Deviation:
[brief description of why actual effort differed from estimate]

Scope Stability:
[brief note on whether the scope changed during execution]

Confidence in Original Estimate:
[rating out of 5] — [optional one-line rationale]
```

## Alternatives Considered

- **[FORMAT] Informal freeform notes**  
  *Rejected.* Freeform writing is valuable for discovery but reduces consistency and makes analysis difficult.

- **[FORMAT] Pure quantitative model (e.g., confidence = 80%)**  
  *Rejected.* Over-quantifying confidence loses nuance and creates a false sense of precision.

- **[AUTOMATION] Rely on velocity trends only**  
  *Rejected.* Team velocity masks individual drift and doesn't highlight the why behind variances.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enables a lightweight form of estimation retro with negligible overhead
- Provides structured
